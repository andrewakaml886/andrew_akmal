                    I learned the Python programming language because it is easy and flexible, and is <br>
                    used in many fields such as web development and data analysis. I started by learning <br>
                    the basics like variables and loops, and then applied them to simple projects. Over time. <br>
                    I came to understand more advanced concepts such as object-oriented programming and mathematical <br>

                    I learned Arduino programming because it allows me to control electronic devices easily. I started by <br>
                    understanding the components of the Arduino board and how to connect them to the sensors and motors. <br>
                    I learned to write simple codes using C++ to turn lights on and off and measure temperatures. Over time, <br>
                    I was able to create more complex projects such as Bluetooth remote control systems and motion sensors. <br>
                    Learning Arduino helped me gain practical skills in electronics and programming, and develop creative project ideas.
